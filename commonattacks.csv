Attack Type, Definition
General Phishing, A simple, mass phishing attack which doesn't target anyone in particular, although they may aim for large groups (e.g. PayPal users, or Amazon customers). These large-scale campaigns are usually simple and are generally (but not always) fairly easy to spot as the messages and malicious sites are often not very well crafted and frequently contain many immediately visible errors.
Spearphishing, More targeted than general phishing, spearphishing aims for an individual or small group (e.g. employees of a specific company). Spearphishing campaigns are generally better crafted than the correspondence and malicious sites used in general phishing as they are designed to target a particular group, often as part of a more extensive campaign against the target.
Whaling, Even more specific than spearphishing, whaling targets high-value individuals (e.g. a C-Suite executive in a target company). The messages are generally extremely well crafted and tend to be very hard to spot.
